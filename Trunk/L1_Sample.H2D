this a UHS II Layer 1 command file
Each command needs to be written on a new line
commands not recognized are interpreted as comments and are skipped
commands are case insensitive
space ( as " " ) will be used to separate multiple symbols or data
column 1 : is used to mark the physical lane used
column 2 : is used to mark the packet handler we want to call. This might look like an L1 symbol sometimes, but it can be handled as we want inside the code
column 3 : is used to count the number of times the packet should be sent repeatedly. Most packet should be sent twice


Initialize the Lane : Dormant -> Wakup 
Repeate STB.L(DIF-L) until Dormant state is exited and Device enters Wakeup State. You need to repeat STB.L signal many enough times until Device replies with same STB.L
0 STB.L	10
Repeate SYN until Wakeup state is exited and Device enters Config State. If you want to load special boot code you will need to send BSYN
0 SYN 	4
Repeate SYN until Config state is exited and Device enters Active State
0 LIDL 	1

Initialize the Lane :  Config -> Active


do some stuff here

ex read
0 DCMDR	2 2 3	-> 	we want to read from address 2, data block count 3
0 NOP 	1		-> 	Device will send us RES
0 NOP 	1		->	Device will send us FCREQ
0 FCRDY 1
0 NOP 	N		->	Device will send us Data N times
0 STAT 	1 X	->	We confirm that we got data
0 FCRDY 1	->	Allow device to send more
0 NOP N		->	More data incomming
0 STAT 1 X	->	Thank you for the data

ex write
0 DCMDW	1	->	we want to write
0 NOP 1		->	device sends RES
0 FCREQ 1	
0 NOP 1		->	device sends us FCRDY
0 DATA N Y
0 NOP 1		->	device send us STAT
